CSS Unexpected Rules

1. Vertical Margins Collapse
2. Inline Content ignores vertical margin, border and padding.
3. Vertically aligning text and images on the same line, requires aligning the image not the text.
4. Text align, aligns inline content in a block. Not blocks themselves. To align blocks, give the block a widget, and set the left and right margins to zero.
5. When using floats, to prevent content from flowing around floated content, use clear.
